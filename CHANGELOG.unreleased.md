### Packages to release

> Packages will be released in the order they are here, therefore, they should
> be listed by inverse order of dependency.
>
> Rule of thumb: add packages on top.
>
> The format is the following: - `$packageName` `$version`
>
> Where `$version` is
>
> - patch: if the change is a bug fix or a simple code improvement
> - minor: if the change is a new feature
> - major: if the change breaks compatibility
>
> In case of conflict, the highest (lowest in previous list) `$version` wins.
