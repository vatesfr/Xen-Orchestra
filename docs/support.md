# Support

You can access our pro support if you subscribe to any of these plans:

* Free  
* Starter
* Enterprise
* Premium

Higher tier support plans include faster ticket response times. Paid support plans and response times are based on the plan you have, plans can be [reviewed here](https://xen-orchestra.com/#!/xo-pricing).

## Free limited support

With the free version of the Xen Orchestra Appliance (XOA free), you can open support tickets and we will do our best to assist you, however, this support is limited and is not guaranteed in regards to response times or resolutions offered.

## Community support

If you are using Xen Orchestra via the source and not XOA, you can ask questions and try to recieve help through a number of different ways:

* In our [forum](https://xcp-ng.org/forum/category/12/xen-orchestra)
* In our IRC - `#xen-orchestra` on `Freenode`

We encourage you to give back to the community by assisting other users via these two avenues as well.

Lastly while Xen Orchestra is free and Open Source software, supporting and developing it takes a lot of effort. If you are considering using Xen Orchestra in production, please subscribe for one of our [professional support plans](https://xen-orchestra.com/#!/xo-pricing).

## Open a ticket

If you have a subscription (or at least a registered free XOA), you can open a ticket describing your issue directly from your personal account page [here](https://xen-orchestra.com/#!/member/support)
