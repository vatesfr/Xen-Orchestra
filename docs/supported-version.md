# Xen Orchestra compatibility

Xen Orchestra is designed to work exclusively on [XCP-ng](https://xcp-ng.org/) and [Citrix XenServer](https://xenserver.org/) hypervisor (any version). Xen Orchestra should be fully functional with any version of these two hypervisors. However, to benefit from the best support quality, our product is tested to work the best with the following versions:

## Citrix XenServer (Citrix hypervisor)

Backup restore for large VM disks (>1TiB usage) is [broken on all XenServer versions](https://bugs.xenserver.org/browse/XSO-868) until Citrix release a fix.

  - [VDI I/O error](https://bugs.xenserver.org/browse/XSO-873), waiting for Citrix to release our fix
