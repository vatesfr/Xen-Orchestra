# SDN Controller

> SDN Controller is available in XOA 5.44 and higher

The SDN Controller enables a user to **create pool-wide and cross-pool** (since XOA 5.48.1) **private networks**.

## How does it work?

Please read the [dedicated devblog on the SDN Controller](https://xen-orchestra.com/blog/xo-sdn-controller/) and its [extension for cross-pool private networks](https://xen-orchestra.com/blog/devblog-3-extending-the-sdn-controller/).

## Usage

### Network creation

In the network creation view:

- Select a `pool`
- Select `Private network`
- Select an interface on which to create the network's tunnels
- Select the encapsulation: a choice is offered between `GRE` and `VxLAN`, if `VxLAN` is chosen, then port 4789 must be open for UDP traffic on all the network's hosts (see [the requirements](#vxlan))
- Choose if the network should be encrypted or not (see [the requirements](#encryption) to use encryption)
- Select other `pool`s to add them to the network if desired
  - For each added `pool`: select an interface on which to create the tunnels
- Create the network
- Have fun! ☺

**_NB:_**

- All hosts in a private network must be able to reach the other hosts' management interface.
  > The term ‘management interface’ is used to indicate the IP-enabled NIC that carries the management traffic.
- Only 1 encrypted GRE network and 1 encrypted VxLAN network per pool can exist at a time due to Open vSwitch limitation.

### Configuration

Like all other xo-server plugins, it can be configured directly via
the web interface, see [the plugin documentation](https://xen-orchestra.com/docs/plugins.html).

The plugin's configuration contains:

- `cert-dir`: The path where the plugin will look for the certificates to create SSL connections with the hosts.
  If none is provided, the plugin will create its own self-signed certificates.
- `override-certs`: Enable to uninstall the existing SDN controller CA certificate in order to replace it with the plugin's one.

## Requirements

### VxLAN

- On XCP-ng prior to 7.6:
  - To be able to use `VxLAN`, the following line needs to be added, if not already present, in `/etc/sysconfig/iptables` of all the hosts where `VxLAN` is wanted: `-A xapi-INPUT -p udp -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -m udp --dport 4789 -j ACCEPT`

### Encryption

> Encryption is not available prior to 8.0.

- On XCP-ng 8.0:
  - To be able to encrypt the networks, `openvswitch-ipsec` package must be installed on all the hosts:
    - `yum install openvswitch-ipsec --enablerepo=xcp-ng-testing`
    - `systemctl enable ipsec`
    - `systemctl enable openvswitch-ipsec`
    - `systemctl start ipsec`
    - `systemctl start openvswitch-ipsec`
