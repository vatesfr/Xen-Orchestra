# xo-server-sdn-controller [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vatesfr/xen-orchestra.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vatesfr/xen-orchestra)

XO Server plugin that allows the creation of pool-wide private networks.

## Install

For installing XO and the plugins from the sources, please take a look at [the documentation](https://xen-orchestra.com/docs/from_the_sources.html).

## Usage

### Network creation

In the network creation view, select a `pool` and `Private network`.
Create the network.

Choice is offer between `GRE` and `VxLAN`, if `VxLAN` is chosen, then the port 4789 must be open for UDP traffic.
The following line needs to be added, if not already present, in `/etc/sysconfig/iptables` of all the hosts where `VxLAN` is wanted:
`-A xapi-INPUT -p udp -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -m udp --dport 4789 -j ACCEPT`

### Configuration

Like all other xo-server plugins, it can be configured directly via
the web interface, see [the plugin documentation](https://xen-orchestra.com/docs/plugins.html).

The plugin's configuration contains:
- `cert-dir`: A path where to find the certificates to create SSL connections with the hosts.
If none is provided, the plugin will create its own self-signed certificates.
- `override-certs:` Whether or not to uninstall an already existing SDN controller CA certificate in order to replace it by the plugin's one.

Contributions are *very* welcomed, either on the documentation or on
the code.
